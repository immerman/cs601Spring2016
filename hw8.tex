In the following problems, you may assume that QSAT is PSPACE complete and MCVP is P complete. (Both
of these are proved in Lecture 10.)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that EMPTY-CFL is P-complete.  Note that we already
proved this was in P in Hw 4.  I suggest that you reduce MCVP to
EMPTY-CFL.  

\item Let $S_2  \se \bigset{(a,w,1^r)}{M_a(w) =1 \mbox{ using at most $r$ work-tape cells.}}$
Prove that $S_2$ is PSPACE complete.

\item  Let $S_3 \se \bigset{(G,\phi)}{\mbox{$G$ a graph, $\phi$ a first-order formula, $G\models
    \phi$}}$   Prove that $S_3$ is PSPACE complete.  [I suggest you reduce QSAT to $S_3$.]


\end{enumerate}

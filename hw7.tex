Please make sure that you have completed the solutions to the homework problems that you are
responsible for.   To start getting ready for the midterm, March 1, it would be good for everyone to
go over all these solutions and make sure that you understand them.  (Helping with corrections and
proof reading would be appreciated.)

Show that the following three problems are all NL complete:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  EMPTY-DFA $ = \bigset{D}{D \mbox{ a deterministic finite automaton and } \sel(D) =
  \emptyset}$ 

\vspace*{.1in}

\item EMPTY-NFA $ = \bigset{N}{N \mbox{ a nondeterministic finite automaton and } \sel(N) =\emptyset}$

\vspace*{.1in}

\item EQUAL-DFA $ =  \bigset{(D_1,D_2)}{D_1,D_2 \mbox{ DFAs};\;\sel(D_1) =\sel(D_2)}$


\end{enumerate}
\end{document}
